# TODO List

This list is here to keep track of things that can still be done, but not things that has to be done

### Mattis-Bardeen superconductor conductivity

The Mattis-Bardeen superconductor conductivity implementation is fully
functional. Only numerical stability and validation improvements are left.

* Analytically perform the Mattis-Bardeen complex conductivity first real interval transform
* Analytically perform the Mattis-Bardeen complex conductivity imaginary interval transform
* Find out where the sign inversion in the Mattis-Bardeen expression comes from

### Interpolating functions

* Interpolating gap energy
* Interpolating superconductor conductivity
