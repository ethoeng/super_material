# TODO List

This list is here to keep track of things that can still be done, but not things that has to be done

### Mattis-Bardeen superconductor conductivity

The Mattis-Bardeen superconductor conductivity implementation is fully functional. Only numerical stability, performance, and validation improvements are left.

* Analytically perform all the integral interval transforms
* Perform common sub expression elimination on integrand evaluations
* Find out where the sign inversion in the Mattis-Bardeen expression comes from

### Zimmermann superconductor conductivity

The Zimmermann superconductor conductivity implementation is fully functional.  Only numerical stability and performance improvements are left.

* Analytically perform all the integral interval transforms
* Find improved integral interval transforms
* Perform common sub expression elimination on integrand evaluations
